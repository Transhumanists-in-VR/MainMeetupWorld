What is Transhumanism?
Transhumanism is the idea that humans should use science and technology to transcend their limitations.

This world is our home in VR. There's lots of information here on theory and practice. Visit our discord if you're interested!

Why transhumanism?

Our natural state has many ills. We suffer starvation, exposure, aging, conflict, poverty, & more. But we have a way of fighting back: science, technology, & reason. It's becoming possible to apply these tools directly to ourselves and become superhuman.


Is humanity perfect? No? Then improvements are to be welcomed.

Ethics

"This sounds like it has ethical implications. What if I don't want to be modified? Can't we wait until we conclusively know it's safe?"


There are two foundational principles at the core of transhumanist ethics:
Body Freedom
Proactionary Principle

--
Body Freedom

Body freedom is the notion that individuals own their own bodies, and should be allowed to modify or not modify them at will without coercion.

It is the only non-paradoxical solution to the problem of 'who gets to decide what counts as a body upgrade'

--
Proactionary Principle

Traditional ethics promotes the 'precautionary principle.' It holds that a new technology should be prohibited until it is proven to be totally safe.

Transhumanists claim that this stifles innovation & causes preventable suffering. We hold the 'proactionary principle' where people innovate until harms become known, then adapt to reverse them & prevent them from reoccuring

What will you become?

Science is evolving rapidly, and almost any form is possible. Knowing this, picture your ideal self. What is the 'perfect' you? Biologically immortal? Superintelligent? Superaffectionate? Biological or mechanical? Both?

Whatever you become, I hope you join us.
